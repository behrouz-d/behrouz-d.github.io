    title: About me
    summary: |
      I am a Database/Machine Learning researcher in [DFKI](https://dfki.de/) and an PhD candidate at [TU Berlin](https://www.tu.berlin) mentored by 
      [Volker Markl](https://www.dima.tu-berlin.de/menue/mitarbeiter/volker_markl) and cooperating with 
      [Tilmann Rabl](https://hpi.de/rabl/team/prof-dr-tilmann-rabl.html) and [Zoi Kaoudi](https://www.user.tu-berlin.de/zkaoudi/).
      My research interests are scalable machine learning and management of end-to-end machine learning pipelines. 
      
      Previously, I worked as a data engineer/senior data engineer in [Rovio Entertainment](hhttps://www.rovio.com/). 
      I received my MSc degree from [University of Helsinki](https://www.ethz.ch/en.html) under supervision of 
      [Hannu Toivonen](https://www2.helsinki.fi/en/researchgroups/computational-creativity-and-data-mining/hannu-toivonen) and 
      [Hannes Heikinheimo](https://www.linkedin.com/in/hannesheikinheimo/).
